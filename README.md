Let's dive into it:
HTML:
In the HTML part, I structured the content of the Todo List application.

1. Document Structure:
   - I began with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration to specify that the document is an HTML5 document.
   - `<html lang="en">` indicates that the document is written in English.
   - In the `<head>` section, I included meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings, along with a title for the web page.
   - I linked an external CSS file (`<link rel="stylesheet" href="./todo.css">`) to style the HTML elements.

2. Content Structure:
   - Within the `<body>` element, I structured the content of the Todo List application within a `<div>` with the class `todo-content`.
   - Inside this `div`, I included a heading (`<h2>Todo List</h2>`), an input field for adding todos, and an unordered list (`<ul>`) to display the todos.

3. JavaScript Integration:
   - To add interactivity and functionality, I linked an external JavaScript file (`<script src="./script.js"></script>`).

CSS:
For styling the Todo List application, I utilized CSS.

1. Selector-Property Pairs:
   - Within the CSS file, I defined styles for various HTML elements and classes.
   - I set styles for `body`, `.todo-content`, `input[type="text"]`, `button`, etc.

2. Layout and Design:
   - I used CSS to define the layout and design of the Todo List application, such as background colors, font styles, padding, margins, and box shadows.
   - My aim was to make the application visually appealing and user-friendly.

JavaScript:
JavaScript added interactivity and dynamic behavior to the Todo List application.
1. Event Handling:
   - I handled user interactions using JavaScript, such as adding todos when the user clicks the "Add" button.
   - Events like `onclick` were used to trigger functions like `addTodo()`.

2. Dynamic Content Manipulation:
   - JavaScript allowed me to dynamically manipulate the content of the web page.
   - Functions like `displayTodos()`, `deleteTodo()`, `editTodo()`, and `toggleDone()` were used to add, display, delete, edit, and toggle the completion status of todos, respectively.

I hope this explanation gives you a clear understanding of my Todo List application I created.
